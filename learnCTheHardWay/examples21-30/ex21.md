## Type Modifiers
### unsigned
Changes the type so that it does not have negative numbers, giving
you a larger upper bound

### signed
Gives you negative and positive numbers, but halves your upper bound
in exchange for the same lower bound

### long
Uses a larger storage for the type so that it can hold bigger
numbers, usually doubling the current size

### short
Uses smaller storage for the type so it stores less, but takes
half of the space

## Type Qualifiers
### const
Indicates the variable won't change after being initialized

### volatile
Indicates that all bets are off, and the compiler should leave
this alone and try not to do any fancy optimizations to it.
You usually only need this if you're doing really weird stuff
to your variables

### register
Forces the compiler to keep this variable in a register, and
the compiler can just ignore you. These days compilers are
better at figuring out where to put variables, so only use
this if you actually can measure it improving speed.

## Type Conversion 
C automatically converts up this list if they appear on both
sides of an equation. 
```
  - long double
  - double
  - float
  - int (but only `char` and `short int`)
  - long
```

If you want to force a type put it in `()` before.
Example:
```C
long + char - int * double

(double)long - (double)char - (double)int * double
```
